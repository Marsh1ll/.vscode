         <p>
            Apparently, on Windows 11 (and probably 10, can't relate) when you log into your microsoft account on
            the system, it takes the first five letters of your OneDrive email address and makes that the name of your
            laptop main admin user account. As per that I no too know book, I didn't know any of this, so I was 
            struggling to figure out a way to change it. My labours led me to the almighty google, where I found a 
            way to sha change it sha. The unforeseen problem though, was that when I opened regedit to do the 
            falafolo that the people on the internet told me to do, stuff went weird and some configurations 
            had to be changed and rerouted.<br>
            Bottom line sha, is that i lost the daily diary of code that i had been coding because i had to uninstall 
            and delete my former version of VsCode. I'm not crying, there's just a lot of dust in the air.

            Kashamadupe though. I've been able to reinstall this blue weird-looking software and I'm getting back on track.
            Still don't feel like I'm doing anything useful yet, but baby steps.
